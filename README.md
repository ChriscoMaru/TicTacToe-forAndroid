# TicTacToe-forAndroid
A simple game of TicTacToe compatible with mobile devices running Android Lollipop and its successors. 
Created using Android Studio, as a final project for an Introduction to Android development bootcamp I was taking.
Currently takes in both users scores and saves them, also has a working reset game button.
